Self Driving Car

This repository contains the code for a self driving car that uses deep learning, computer vision, and convolutional neural networks. The car is controlled using a behavioral cloning algorithm, which trains a neural network to imitate the driving behavior of a human driver.

The car is controlled using a keyboard. The user can press on A and D to control the car's steering angle. The car can also be accelerated and braked using W and S.

The car is equipped with a camera that is used to collect data for the neural network. The camera captures images of the road ahead, and the neural network uses these images to predict the steering angle that the car should take.

The neural network is trained using a dataset of images and steering angles. The dataset was collected by driving the car around a track manually in the Udacity Car Simulator. The neural network is trained using a technique called supervised learning. In supervised learning, the neural network is given a set of input data (images) and output data (steering angles). The neural network then learns to map the input data to the output data.

Once the neural network is trained, it can be used to control the car. The car can be driven autonomously around the track using the joystick.


The self driving car has the following features:

It can be controlled using keyboard

It can be driven autonomously around a track in the Udacity Car Simulator.

It is controlled using a neural network that was trained using a dataset of images and steering angles.

Limitations

It is not able to handle unexpected events, such as other cars or pedestrians.

It is not yet safe to drive on public roads.

Future Work

The following are some of the future work that can be done on this project:

Improve the performance of the neural network by using a larger dataset and more advanced training techniques.

Make the car able to handle unexpected events, such as other cars or pedestrians.

Make the car safe to drive on newer random roads.
